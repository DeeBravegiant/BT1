# Q1307: cb-mpc protocol error-state confusion in base_mod.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::schnorr_mp::sign_ac` with ac key blob, access_structure, digest, receiver, and peer messages when public extraction is compared with signing output, reach `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module`, and use input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers to bypass the requirement that outputs are cleared or invalidated on every internal error path, causing a caller receives reusable partial output after validation failure and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp::base_mod module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::schnorr_mp::sign_ac via include/cbmpc/api/schnorr_mp.h`
- Attacker controls: ac key blob, access_structure, digest, receiver, and peer messages; specifically input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers when public extraction is compared with signing output
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::schnorr_mp::sign_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/schnorr_mp.h` with ac key blob, access_structure, digest, receiver, and peer messages when public extraction is compared with signing output. The malicious side supplies input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` assumes outputs are cleared or invalidated on every internal error path was already enforced and therefore lets a caller receives reusable partial output after validation failure.
- Invariant to test: The cb-mpc protocol path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::schnorr_mp::sign_ac` through `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High public-API reachable validation bypass in a supported high-level protocol.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
