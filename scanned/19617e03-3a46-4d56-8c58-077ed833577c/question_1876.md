# Q1876: cb-mpc protocol converter trailing-data trust in curve.h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` with access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext during threshold combine with a minimal quorum, reach `include/cbmpc/api/curve.h` `curve module`, and use serialized object with a valid prefix plus trailing attacker fields to bypass the requirement that deserializers consume the full buffer and reject trailing or missing fields, causing displayed fields differ from internal parsed fields and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `include/cbmpc/api/curve.h::curve module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac via include/cbmpc/api/tdh2.h`
- Attacker controls: access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext; specifically serialized object with a valid prefix plus trailing attacker fields during threshold combine with a minimal quorum
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/tdh2.h` with access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext during threshold combine with a minimal quorum. The malicious side supplies serialized object with a valid prefix plus trailing attacker fields. Investigate whether `include/cbmpc/api/curve.h` `curve module` assumes deserializers consume the full buffer and reject trailing or missing fields was already enforced and therefore lets displayed fields differ from internal parsed fields.
- Invariant to test: The cb-mpc protocol path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` through `include/cbmpc/api/curve.h`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High public-API reachable validation bypass in a supported high-level protocol.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate serialized object with a valid prefix plus trailing attacker fields; assert rejection before `include/cbmpc/api/curve.h` `curve module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
