# Q3081: ZK proof ElGamal commitment reuse in zk_unknown_order.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` with key_blob and malicious refresh transcript after a failed attempt is retried with fresh inputs, reach `src/cbmpc/zk/zk_unknown_order.cpp` `verify`, and use ElGamal commitment values replayed across sessions or statement contexts to bypass the requirement that commitments are rerandomized or transcript-bound before proofs/signing equations, causing commitment relation leaks share information or validates a false statement and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/zk/zk_unknown_order.cpp::verify`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh via include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h`
- Attacker controls: key_blob and malicious refresh transcript; specifically ElGamal commitment values replayed across sessions or statement contexts after a failed attempt is retried with fresh inputs
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` in `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h` with key_blob and malicious refresh transcript after a failed attempt is retried with fresh inputs. The malicious side supplies ElGamal commitment values replayed across sessions or statement contexts. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/zk/zk_unknown_order.cpp` `verify` assumes commitments are rerandomized or transcript-bound before proofs/signing equations was already enforced and therefore lets commitment relation leaks share information or validates a false statement.
- Invariant to test: The ZK proof path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` through `src/cbmpc/zk/zk_unknown_order.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): Critical key compromise or significant disclosure/substitution of sensitive key material through supported public APIs.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate ElGamal commitment values replayed across sessions or statement contexts; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/zk/zk_unknown_order.cpp` `verify` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
