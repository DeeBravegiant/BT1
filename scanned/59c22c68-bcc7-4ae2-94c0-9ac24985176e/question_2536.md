# Q2536: PVE error-state confusion in pve_batch.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` with ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares when the same caller alternates valid and mutated blobs, reach `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_batch.cpp` `restore_from_decrypted`, and use input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers to bypass the requirement that outputs are cleared or invalidated on every internal error path, causing a caller receives reusable partial output after validation failure and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_batch.cpp::restore_from_decrypted`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac via include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h`
- Attacker controls: ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares; specifically input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers when the same caller alternates valid and mutated blobs
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h` with ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares when the same caller alternates valid and mutated blobs. The malicious side supplies input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_batch.cpp` `restore_from_decrypted` assumes outputs are cleared or invalidated on every internal error path was already enforced and therefore lets a caller receives reusable partial output after validation failure.
- Invariant to test: The PVE path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` through `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_batch.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High public-API reachable validation bypass in a supported high-level protocol.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate input that triggers an inner parse/proof failure after partially filling output buffers; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_batch.cpp` `restore_from_decrypted` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
