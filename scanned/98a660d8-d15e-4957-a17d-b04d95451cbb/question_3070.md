# Q3070: PVE label substitution in pve_ac.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::pve::verify_ac` with ciphertext, expected Qs, access_structure, leaf keys, and label when public extraction is compared with signing output, reach `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_ac.cpp` `encrypt`, and use two attacker-chosen labels with different security contexts to bypass the requirement that labels are authenticated into every ciphertext, proof, partial decryption, and combine operation, causing a ciphertext or share verified for one label is accepted for another and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_ac.cpp::encrypt`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::pve::verify_ac via include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h`
- Attacker controls: ciphertext, expected Qs, access_structure, leaf keys, and label; specifically two attacker-chosen labels with different security contexts when public extraction is compared with signing output
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::pve::verify_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h` with ciphertext, expected Qs, access_structure, leaf keys, and label when public extraction is compared with signing output. The malicious side supplies two attacker-chosen labels with different security contexts. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_ac.cpp` `encrypt` assumes labels are authenticated into every ciphertext, proof, partial decryption, and combine operation was already enforced and therefore lets a ciphertext or share verified for one label is accepted for another.
- Invariant to test: The PVE path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::pve::verify_ac` through `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_ac.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High accepted cryptographic output bound to the wrong curve, key, label, session, party set, or protocol version.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate two attacker-chosen labels with different security contexts; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/protocol/pve_ac.cpp` `encrypt` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
