# Q1179: access-structure public key extraction mismatch in lagrange.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` with ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares when labels or sids are reused across supported flows, reach `src/cbmpc/crypto/lagrange.cpp` `lagrange module`, and use key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields to bypass the requirement that exported public key is derived from the same validated state used by signing, causing caller authorizes one public key while protocol signs with another and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/crypto/lagrange.cpp::lagrange module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac via include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h`
- Attacker controls: ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares; specifically key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields when labels or sids are reused across supported flows
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/pve_batch_ac.h` with ciphertext, attempt_index, label, and quorum_shares when labels or sids are reused across supported flows. The malicious side supplies key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/crypto/lagrange.cpp` `lagrange module` assumes exported public key is derived from the same validated state used by signing was already enforced and therefore lets caller authorizes one public key while protocol signs with another.
- Invariant to test: The access-structure path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::pve::combine_ac` through `src/cbmpc/crypto/lagrange.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High accepted cryptographic output bound to the wrong curve, key, label, session, party set, or protocol version.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/crypto/lagrange.cpp` `lagrange module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
