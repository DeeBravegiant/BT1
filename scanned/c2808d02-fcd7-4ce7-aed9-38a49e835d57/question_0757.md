# Q757: TDH2 malformed point acceptance in tdh2.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` with access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext during threshold combine with a minimal quorum, reach `src/cbmpc/api/tdh2.cpp` `dkg_ac`, and use non-canonical compressed point, infinity encoding, low-order Ed25519 point, or off-curve SEC1 bytes to bypass the requirement that all peer points are canonicalized and curve/subgroup checked before arithmetic, causing an invalid public share, commitment, or proof point is accepted and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/api/tdh2.cpp::dkg_ac`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac via include/cbmpc/api/tdh2.h`
- Attacker controls: access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext; specifically non-canonical compressed point, infinity encoding, low-order Ed25519 point, or off-curve SEC1 bytes during threshold combine with a minimal quorum
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/tdh2.h` with access_structure, party_names, public_shares, label, partial names, partial decryptions, and ciphertext during threshold combine with a minimal quorum. The malicious side supplies non-canonical compressed point, infinity encoding, low-order Ed25519 point, or off-curve SEC1 bytes. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/api/tdh2.cpp` `dkg_ac` assumes all peer points are canonicalized and curve/subgroup checked before arithmetic was already enforced and therefore lets an invalid public share, commitment, or proof point is accepted.
- Invariant to test: The TDH2 path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::tdh2::combine_ac` through `src/cbmpc/api/tdh2.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High public-API reachable validation bypass in a supported high-level protocol.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate non-canonical compressed point, infinity encoding, low-order Ed25519 point, or off-curve SEC1 bytes; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/api/tdh2.cpp` `dkg_ac` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
