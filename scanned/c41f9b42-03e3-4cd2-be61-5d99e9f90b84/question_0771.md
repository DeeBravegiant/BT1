# Q771: cb-mpc protocol public share substitution in base_mod.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::attach_private_scalar` with public_key_blob, fixed scalar, and public share point when public extraction is compared with signing output, reach `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module`, and use public_share_compressed from one blob paired with scalar from another blob to bypass the requirement that attach APIs bind scalar to blob role, curve, public share, public key, and party, causing attacker restores scalar into a blob that should not be sign-capable and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp::base_mod module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::attach_private_scalar via include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h`
- Attacker controls: public_key_blob, fixed scalar, and public share point; specifically public_share_compressed from one blob paired with scalar from another blob when public extraction is compared with signing output
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::attach_private_scalar` in `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h` with public_key_blob, fixed scalar, and public share point when public extraction is compared with signing output. The malicious side supplies public_share_compressed from one blob paired with scalar from another blob. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` assumes attach APIs bind scalar to blob role, curve, public share, public key, and party was already enforced and therefore lets attacker restores scalar into a blob that should not be sign-capable.
- Invariant to test: The cb-mpc protocol path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::attach_private_scalar` through `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): Critical key compromise or significant disclosure/substitution of sensitive key material through supported public APIs.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate public_share_compressed from one blob paired with scalar from another blob; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
