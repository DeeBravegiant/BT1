# Q17: serialization/core blob version confusion in buf128.h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::sign` with key_blob, msg_hash, sid, and malicious two-party transcript during backup verification before recovery, reach `include/cbmpc/core/buf128.h` `buf128 module`, and use a valid-prefix blob with altered version/type tag and trailing attacker fields to bypass the requirement that the public wrapper fully consumes serialized blobs and rejects wrong protocol versions before internal conversion, causing a protocol object is interpreted as the wrong role, curve, or blob type and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `include/cbmpc/core/buf128.h::buf128 module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::sign via include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h`
- Attacker controls: key_blob, msg_hash, sid, and malicious two-party transcript; specifically a valid-prefix blob with altered version/type tag and trailing attacker fields during backup verification before recovery
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::sign` in `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h` with key_blob, msg_hash, sid, and malicious two-party transcript during backup verification before recovery. The malicious side supplies a valid-prefix blob with altered version/type tag and trailing attacker fields. Investigate whether `include/cbmpc/core/buf128.h` `buf128 module` assumes the public wrapper fully consumes serialized blobs and rejects wrong protocol versions before internal conversion was already enforced and therefore lets a protocol object is interpreted as the wrong role, curve, or blob type.
- Invariant to test: The serialization/core path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::sign` through `include/cbmpc/core/buf128.h`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High accepted cryptographic output bound to the wrong curve, key, label, session, party set, or protocol version.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate a valid-prefix blob with altered version/type tag and trailing attacker fields; assert rejection before `include/cbmpc/core/buf128.h` `buf128 module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
