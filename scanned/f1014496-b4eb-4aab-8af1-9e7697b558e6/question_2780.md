# Q2780: cb-mpc protocol public key extraction mismatch in base_mod.cpp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` with key_blob and malicious refresh transcript while two sessions run concurrently, reach `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module`, and use key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields to bypass the requirement that exported public key is derived from the same validated state used by signing, causing caller authorizes one public key while protocol signs with another and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp::base_mod module`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh via include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h`
- Attacker controls: key_blob and malicious refresh transcript; specifically key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields while two sessions run concurrently
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` in `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_2p.h` with key_blob and malicious refresh transcript while two sessions run concurrently. The malicious side supplies key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields. Investigate whether `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` assumes exported public key is derived from the same validated state used by signing was already enforced and therefore lets caller authorizes one public key while protocol signs with another.
- Invariant to test: The cb-mpc protocol path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::ecdsa_2p::refresh` through `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): High accepted cryptographic output bound to the wrong curve, key, label, session, party set, or protocol version.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate key_blob whose public-key extraction path and signing path parse different fields; assert rejection before `src/cbmpc/crypto/base_mod.cpp` `base_mod module` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
