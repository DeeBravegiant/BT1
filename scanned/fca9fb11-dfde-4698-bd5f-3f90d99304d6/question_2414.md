# Q2414: ECDSA-MP message digest semantic confusion in ecdsa_mp.h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::sign_ac` with ac_key_blob, access_structure, msg, sig_receiver, and malicious peer messages when public extraction is compared with signing output, reach `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h` `detach_private_scalar`, and use signing input with wrong length, leading zeros, or raw-message-versus-digest ambiguity to bypass the requirement that ECDSA/Schnorr enforce exact digest semantics while EdDSA binds raw message, causing valid signature is produced over unintended message bytes and producing an in-scope cb-mpc bounty impact?

## Target
- File/function: `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h::detach_private_scalar`
- Entrypoint: `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::sign_ac via include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h`
- Attacker controls: ac_key_blob, access_structure, msg, sig_receiver, and malicious peer messages; specifically signing input with wrong length, leading zeros, or raw-message-versus-digest ambiguity when public extraction is compared with signing output
- Exploit idea: Start from supported public API `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::sign_ac` in `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h` with ac_key_blob, access_structure, msg, sig_receiver, and malicious peer messages when public extraction is compared with signing output. The malicious side supplies signing input with wrong length, leading zeros, or raw-message-versus-digest ambiguity. Investigate whether `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h` `detach_private_scalar` assumes ECDSA/Schnorr enforce exact digest semantics while EdDSA binds raw message was already enforced and therefore lets valid signature is produced over unintended message bytes.
- Invariant to test: The ECDSA-MP path must preserve curve, key/blob version, party identity, session or label context, access-structure semantics, and validated encodings from `coinbase::api::ecdsa_mp::sign_ac` through `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Coinbase cb-mpc bounty (HackerOne, not Immunefi): Critical valid signing result without required honest two-party or threshold participation.
- Fast validation: Write a local public-API harness with one honest unmodified party and malicious fake transport or buffers; mutate signing input with wrong length, leading zeros, or raw-message-versus-digest ambiguity; assert rejection before `include/cbmpc/api/ecdsa_mp.h` `detach_private_scalar` can produce a valid-looking signature, key blob, proof, ciphertext, plaintext, public share, or recovered scalar.
